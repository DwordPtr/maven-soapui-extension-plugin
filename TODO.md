# Development todo list #

## Parent ##
- move to parent (version 3)
  - complier config
  - animalsniffer
  - maven minimum version
  - release must be done with maven 3 (see https://github.com/redfish4ktc/redfish4ktc-maven-parent/wiki#wiki-release)
     - configuration of enforcer must be different when performing release (use the release profile to check this)
     - doc (build will failed if maven 3.0.4+ is not used)


## Integration tests ##
  - all pom should use the project version as version (@project.version@)
  - avoid duplication in verify script (expecially log parsing): put duplicate code in a java class (see  
http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-invoker-plugin/examples/access-test-classes.html)
  - check if we need to force the "â€“Djava.headless=false" when running test
  - remove duplication in soapui configuration (settings, projects)
  - add tests with composite projects
  - test goal default log directory: also check they are no log file in base directory (cf related test of convert-project goal)


## Mojo implementation ##
  - test and mock goal does not declare mandatory parameter as required (see plugin.xml). Instead, null check is done in mojo implementation
  - Check parameters that should be declared as File instead of String
  - plugin.xml: test goal should not declare a 'project' parameter, it should only be configured in the configuration section


### Documentation ###

**Tips page**

* document how to configure scripts and ext directory
* talk about default value (everything in basedir)
* put the 'Avoid log warnings at startup' section just before logs tips + modify link/text according to the new documentation about scripts and ext


### Have a look on invoker goal parameters ###
see http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-invoker-plugin/run-mojo.html


invoker.maven.version = 2.0.10+, !2.1.0, !2.2.0

cloneClean  
boolean	1.6	Ensure the cloneProjectsTo directory is not polluted with files from earlier invoker runs.  
Default value is: false.

showErrors  
boolean	1.0	Whether to show errors in the build output.  
Default value is: false.  

streamLogs
boolean	1.0	Flag used to determine whether the build logs should be output to the normal mojo log.  
Default value is: false.

reportsDirectory  
File	1.4	Base directory where all build reports are written to. Every execution of an integration test will produce an XML file which contains the information about success or failure of that particular build job. The format of the resulting XML file is documented in the given build-job reference.  
Default value is: ${project.build.directory}/invoker-reports.
